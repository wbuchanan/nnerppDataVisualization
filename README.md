# Guiding Principles for Effective Data Visualization
This repository contains the source code used to generate the slides 
and materials used for the talk given to the [National Network of Education Research-Practice Partnerships](http://nnerpp.rice.edu/) 
as part of their Virtual Brown Bag series.  

If there are outstanding questions from the talk, I'll do my best to add
them to this README document along with any answers I can provide.
